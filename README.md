# DetoxJuices Recipes (Front-end Website)

## Project overview
DetoxJuices Recipes is a static front-end website built using HTML5 and CSS3. The website provides simple fruit and vegetable juice recipes using everyday ingredients. Primarily focusing on just two unique recipes.
The aim of this project is to encourage healthier habits by making the recipes easy to understand, visually clear and accessible across different devices.

## Purpose and value
The purpose of this website is to help people who want to improve their diet and not feel overwhelmed by complex recipes. 
The website provides value by keeping juice recipes simple, affordable, and easy to follow, using ingredients that are widely available. By focusing on a small number of clear recipes, the site encourages users to build healthy habits gradually rather than offering too many choices at once.
